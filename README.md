# 🧠 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to explore, summarize, and gain insights from a retail sales dataset in a data warehouse. This includes customer demographics, product categories, sales transactions, and performance metrics.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The project queries data from multiple dimensions and fact tables stored in a schema titled `DataWarehouseAnalytics.gold`. Key tables involved include:

- `dim_customers` – Customer demographics and geography  
- `dim_products` – Product categories, subcategories, and costs  
- `fact_sales` – Transactional sales data

---

## 🛠️ SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Schema and table exploration  
- Aggregations: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`  
- Date manipulation: using `DATEDIFF`, `MIN`, `MAX`, etc.  
- Grouping and filtering with `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`  
- Joins across multiple dimensions  
- Window functions (`RANK() OVER`)  
- Report generation using `UNION ALL`
